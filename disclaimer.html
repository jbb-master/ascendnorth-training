    <h1>Disclaimer for Firearms Training</h1>

    <h2>1. General</h2>
    <p>
      Participation in firearms training offered by AscendNorth Training is at the participant’s own risk
      and responsibility. By booking and attending any training session, participants agree to the following
      terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Legal framework and range rules</h2>
    <p>
      All training is conducted exclusively within the legal framework applicable in Austria and in full
      compliance with the range rules of the shooting facilities used. These rules and regulations are
      binding for all participants.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Participation requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Only persons who meet the following requirements may take part in training:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>they meet all legal requirements for the use and handling of firearms,</li>
      <li>they are not under the influence of alcohol, drugs or mind-altering medication,</li>
      <li>they are physically and mentally capable of following the instructions of the instructor and range staff.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The instructor reserves the right to exclude participants from training who do not meet these requirements
      or who behave in an unsafe or non-compliant manner. In such cases, there is no entitlement to a refund of
      any training fees already paid.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Safety rules and authority</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the entire time on the shooting range, all safety rules, the instructions of the range staff
      and the directions of the instructor must be strictly followed. Failure to comply may result in immediate
      exclusion from the training session for safety reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      AscendNorth Training and the instructor are liable only for damages caused by gross negligence or intent.
      Any liability for slight negligence – in particular for personal injury and property damage – is excluded
      to the extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants are liable for any damage they cause to the shooting range infrastructure, equipment or other
      persons in accordance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Own equipment and firearms</h2>
    <p>
      Where participants use their own firearms or equipment, they are solely responsible for the lawful
      possession, proper maintenance and safe functioning of such items. The instructor does not accept
      liability for damage arising from defective or inadequately maintained equipment owned by participants.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Health and fitness</h2>
    <p>
      Each participant is responsible for taking part only if their physical and mental condition allows it.
      In case of health issues, pre-existing conditions or uncertainty, participants are strongly advised to
      consult a medical professional before participating in any training.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the offer</h2>
    <p>
      AscendNorth Training reserves the right to adjust training content, dates or locations for organisational
      or safety-related reasons, or to cancel sessions altogether. In such cases, training fees already paid
      for services not rendered will be refunded; any further claims are excluded.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Severability clause</h2>
    <p>
      Should any provision of this disclaimer be or become invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the
      remaining provisions shall not be affected. In place of the invalid provision, a valid rule shall apply
      which comes closest to the economic intent of the invalid provision.
